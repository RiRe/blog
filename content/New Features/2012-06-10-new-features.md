Title: New features

Our programmers were busy again. After this update there are plenty of new things to discover in SkyLines...

[![New features]({filename}/images/new-features.jpg)]({filename}/images/new-features.jpg)

- We have added the airfields from the Welt2000 project to the map.
- You can now use your email address to login
- The distance optimizations are visible on the map
- The takeoff and landing airfields are detected automatically
- Each flight has aircraft information now that you can change if the automatic detection fails

Have fun with these new features and let us know what you think!
