Title: Callsigns on the map

SkyLines is now even better at showing multiple flights at the same time.

Previously it was a bit hard to see which glider icon on the map actually belonged to which flight. That has changed now! SkyLines will now show the registered competition signs above the glider icons to identify the gliders.

If you haven't noticed it yet: you can click on the individual flights in the table below the barogram to focus on one flight in specific without losing the others as reference.
