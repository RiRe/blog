Title: Grouped notifications

If you follow many pilots you will get just as many individual notifications if
they upload new flights. Since many pilots are now uploading their old flights
from the Onlinecontest into SkyLines you might probably have even more
notifications at the moment.

Due to the large amount of flight upload notifications we have now grouped them
together where applicable. You can see in the screenshot that mass-uploads are
grouped with a text like "Pilot X has uploaded 42 new flights." and if you click
on the corresponding "Show" button you will see the list of flights as you used
to see it before.
