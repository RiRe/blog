Title: Timeline views
Date: 2013-07-17 16:11:43

Remember on Sunday when we said we will reuse the new event views somewhere
else? Here it is!

[SkyLines](https://skylines.aero) has timeline views for every pilot
and the whole system now. You can easily have a quick look at what your
friends have done lately by watching their stream of public events.


You can find the system timeline at <https://skylines.aero/timeline/>
and the user timelines linked on the individual pilot profiles.


(and yes, at some point we will make those profiles a bit more prettier...!)
