Title: iOS Tracking Client

In the past weeks we have worked on an iOS app for SkyLines Live Tracking and
today we tested it on a longer car drive.

Unfortunately it seems that the iOS platform simply does not allow such
functionality anymore as soon as the device goes to sleep. That means that live
tracking can only work as part of foreground apps like iGlide, but not with a
standalone app.

We are sorry for the bad news, there seems to be nothing we can do about it
unless Apple changes these rules...
