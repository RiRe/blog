Title: Elevation data

SkyLines has terrain data now!

[![Elevation data]({filename}/images/elevation-data.png)]({filename}/images/elevation-data.png)

We have just added the necessary code and data to display the altitude above
ground for all flights in the barogram. Live Tracking is not supported yet, but
we're working on that.

So far we have added data for: Central Europe, South Africa, Australia, New
Zealand
