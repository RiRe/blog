Title: Live Tracking Elevations

SkyLines shows the elevation height in the barogram now also for live tracking!

Last week we added the elevation heights to the uploaded flights and from now on
you will also see how high above the ground the pilots are that use live
tracking.

Aside from that we now use your username initials as callsigns for the live
tracking pages, in case you are watching multiple tracks at once!
